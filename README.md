This project is based on data from the New York Division of Transportation. 
Here's the scenario: 
I'm hired by the New York Division of Transportation as a Data Analyst to make the city's bus system better. The city has too many bus breakdowns and delays, making it hard for people and straining transportation. My job is to study the data to find out why these problems happen.
The following questions will be answered by analyzing the data:
